# üõçÔ∏è Amazon Insights Hub ‚Äì Power BI Sales Dashboard

Welcome to Amazon Insights Hub, an interactive Power BI dashboard project designed to uncover business insights from sales data. This dashboard demonstrates how data visualization, filtering, and interactivity can drive better product and market decisions.

# üìä Project Overview

This project simulates a business scenario where an e-commerce platform (like Amazon) wants to track and analyze sales performance across cities, states, and product categories.
Using Power BI, I built an interactive dashboard that helps answer key business questions like:

1. What are the top-performing states and cities in terms of total sales?
2. How do sales trends vary over time?
3. Which product categories and subcategories contribute the most to revenue?
4. How can slicing data by category help with better product and inventory decisions?

## üß© Key Features
-  **Total Sales Overview**: Track overall performance metrics in one glance.
-  **Sales by City & State**: Identify regional trends and high-revenue areas using bar and map visuals.
-  **Date vs Filtered Sales Graph**: Observe time-based sales patterns with interactive filtering.
-  **Category Button Slicer**: Allows dynamic filtering by product category, updating all visuals in real-time.
-  **Subcategory Drilldown**: On a second page/report, selecting a category reveals a focused view of subcategories, enabling deeper product-level analysis.

## üß† Tools & Concepts Used
- **Power BI**: For dashboard creation and interactivity  
- **DAX**: For calculated fields, measures, and dynamic visuals
